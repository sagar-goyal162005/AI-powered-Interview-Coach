# AI-Powered Interview Coach - Error Fixes and Setup Guide

## Summary of Errors Fixed

This document describes the errors that were identified and fixed in the AI-Powered Interview Coach application.

### 1. Requirements.txt Format Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The requirements.txt file had numbered prefixes (1.streamlit, 2.speech-recognition, etc.) which is invalid format for pip.

**Fix**: Removed numbered prefixes and corrected package names:
```
Before: 1.streamlit, 2.speech-recognition
After:  streamlit, speechrecognition
```

### 2. Unescaped Quotes in Regex Patterns ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Line 478 had unescaped single quotes within raw string regex patterns:
```python
r'\bI\'m not sure\b', r'\bI don\'t know\b'  # ❌ WRONG
```

**Fix**: Changed to use double quotes for these specific patterns:
```python
r"\bI'm not sure\b", r"\bI don't know\b"    # ✅ CORRECT
```

### 3. Missing Dependency Import Errors ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The application would crash when required packages (streamlit, opencv, nltk, etc.) weren't installed.

**Fix**: Made all imports conditional with proper fallbacks:
- Added try/catch blocks around all external package imports
- Created mock classes for missing dependencies
- Added graceful degradation of features when packages are unavailable

### 4. WebRTC Class Inheritance Error ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `VideoTransformerBase` from `streamlit_webrtc` caused inheritance errors when the package wasn't available.

**Fix**: Added conditional import with fallback base class:
```python
try:
    from streamlit_webrtc import VideoTransformerBase
except ImportError:
    class VideoTransformerBase:
        pass
```

### 5. Application Startup Robustness ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: App would fail to start without all dependencies installed.

**Fix**: 
- Added availability flags for each major dependency
- Implemented graceful feature degradation
- Added helpful error messages when running without required packages

## How to Run the Application

### Method 1: Full Installation (Recommended)
1. Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install streamlit nltk numpy sounddevice opencv-python streamlit-webrtc pandas matplotlib speechrecognition
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run hack.py
```

### Method 2: Minimal Installation
1. Install only essential packages:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run hack.py
```
*Note: Some features (video analysis, audio recording) will be limited but core functionality will work.*

### Method 3: Testing Without Dependencies
The application can now be imported and tested even without any external dependencies:
```bash
python3 hack.py
```
This will show a helpful message about how to properly run the Streamlit app.

## Feature Availability by Dependencies

| Feature | Required Packages | Fallback Behavior |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Core App | `streamlit` | Shows helpful setup message |
| Text Analysis | `nltk` | Basic text processing |
| User Management | Built-in packages only | ✅ Always available |
| Video Analysis | `opencv-python`, `streamlit-webrtc` | Displays warning, continues without video |
| Audio Recording | `sounddevice`, `speechrecognition` | Text-only input mode |
| Progress Charts | `pandas`, `matplotlib` | Shows data in text format |
| PDF Reports | `reportlab` | Generates text-based reports |

## Testing the Fixes

Run the verification test to ensure all errors have been fixed:
```bash
python3 /tmp/error_verification_test.py
```

## Application Architecture

The application now has robust error handling with these components:

1. **Conditional Imports**: All external dependencies are imported conditionally
2. **Mock Classes**: Fallback implementations for missing packages
3. **Feature Flags**: Runtime checks for feature availability
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Core functionality works even with minimal dependencies
5. **Clear Error Messages**: Users get helpful guidance when features are unavailable

## Development Notes

- The application is primarily a Streamlit web app
- Core business logic (user management, text analysis) works without external dependencies
- Video and audio features require additional packages but degrade gracefully
- All syntax errors have been resolved
- The codebase is now robust to deployment in various environments

## Next Steps

1. Install Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`
2. Run: `streamlit run hack.py`
3. Optionally install additional packages for enhanced features
4. The application will guide you through available functionality based on installed packages
